Problem 38 part (a)
There are doors named 1~7.
Assume that you will choose the door 1 at first and the car is actually in the door2(this condition will be explained as C2).

When you don't change your choice, the probability of winning is 1/7.
(This is because there are 7 doors)

When you switch to the door2, the possibility of winning a car is 
 P (winning |C2)* 1/7 = 1/3 *1/7= 1/21.

(The last choice has a probability of 1/3, since only one of the three remaining choices is a winner. Also,The probability of a car being at door 2 is 1/7, since there are seven doors.)

The same calculation would be done for each of the doors 2 through 7 per door,
1/21+1/21+1/21+1/21+1/21+1/21
=1/21*6 =2/7

Therefore, you should swtch the door. The probability of success if you switch the door is 2/7.

```{r}
sims <- 100000
doors <- c("goat", "goat", "goat", "goat", "goat", "goat", "car")
result.switch <- result.noswitch <- rep(NA, sims)

for (i in 1:sims) {
  first <- sample(1:7, size = 1)
  result.noswitch[i] <- doors[first]
  remain <- doors[-first]
  if (doors[first] == "car") 
   monty <- sample(1:7, size=3)
  else
   monty <- sample(1:7, size = 3 )[remain == "goat"]
  
    result.switch[i] <- remain[-monty]
}
```
