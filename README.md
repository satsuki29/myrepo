I've been trying to get the R markdown document to Github for hours, but even though I followed the instructions written in "Happy Git and GitHub for the useR",( and I also reffered to https://gist.github.com/JoshuaTPierce/b919168421b40e06481080eb53c3fb2f this page as well)
I couldn't get the document to Git Hub.
So I will put the link here instead.

I'll keep trying to figure this out, but I'm sorry if I couldn't.
