```{r}
set.seed(36850) # set random seed so that you get the same output everytime even though it's "random"

sample_space_coin <- c("H", "T")
event_probs_coin <- c(0.5, 0.5)


coin_flip <- function(){
  sample(
    size = 1,
    x = sample_space_coin,
    prob = event_probs_coin,
    replace = TRUE
  )
}

coin_flip()

```
From the code above, we can simulate a coin flip. 
When coin_flip() was called 10 times, the result was A. This shows that the chances of getting each side of the coin are actually about 0.5 each.

```{r}
