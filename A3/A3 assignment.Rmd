```{r}
library(readr)
ANES <- read_csv("A3/ANES.csv")
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

```


```{r}
# 1
VEP_turnout<- ANES$votes/ANES$VEP *100

ANES<

# 2
head(VEP_turnout)
```

The first value was as expected. The unit of measurement is percentage.

```{r}
# 3
VAP_turnout<- ANES$votes/ANES$VAP *100

```
